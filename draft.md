# Does Lake and Stream Connectivity Control Phosphorus Retention in Lakes?

## Abstract

Lake water residence time and depth are known to be strong predictors of phosphorus (P) retention. However, there is substantial variation in P retention among lakes with the same depth and residence time. One potential explanatory factor for this remaining variation is that connectivity among lakes as well as connectivity between lakes and nearby streams influences either lake P trapping or the type of stream delivered P. Therefore, we examined the extent to which connectivity among lakes versus connectivity between lakes and streams contributes to differences in P retention among lakes. Specifically, we evaluated the effect of lake-based and stream-based connectivity metrics on P retention using a hierarchical parameterization of the Vollenweider equation. We compared Vollenweiderâ€™s k in lakes with high and low stream versus lake connectivity. We found that variation in k is more strongly associated with lake connectivity metrics compared to stream connectivity metrics. This result suggests that lake-associated processes, which likely control P trapping, play a larger role in determining P retention than stream-associated processes which may affect variation in the type of delivered P.

## Introduction

### Importance of P retention

A comprehensive understanding of P cycling at broad scales is necessary to manage the risks of eutrophication from excess nutrient loading (citation). One of the critical steps in the P cycle occurs when P inputs to lakes are subject to processing as a result of uptake, burial, and resuspension (citation). The extent of such processing varying amoung lakes and is known as _P retention_. 

The individual components of in-lake P processing have been the subject of intense study at the individual lake level. **For example, citation A discovered this while citation B showed that.** However, process-based study of these details is not feasible for hundreds of lakes at the regional scale. 

### 

In the present study, we examined the extent to which connectivity among lakes versus connectivity between lakes and streams contributes to differences in P retention among lakes.

## Methods

### Vollenweider

Lake P retention is typically modelled as a non-linear function of water residence time using a set of equations known as the Vollenweider equations (Vollenweider 1975). Although there are several variants of these equations, we use a 2-parameter model that has been shown to have good performance in a variety of cross-sectional studies (Brett and Benjamin, Bayesian paper). The equation takes the form:

\begin{equation}
R_{p} = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + k\tau^{x}}
\end{equation}

where $k$ and $x$ are adjustable (fitted) parameter coefficients and $\tau$ is water residence time. We first used this model to examine the overall relationship between P retention and water residence time for all lakes in the study dataset. Next, we explored hierarchical versions of Eq. 1 with respect to $k$:

\begin{equation}
R_{p} = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + k_{j}\tau^{x}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
k_{j} = partition
\end{equation}

where different values of $k_{j}$ are estimated for each of two sub-populations of the overall lakes dataset. Specifically, we split the overall lakes dataset into a series of sub-populations based on a variety of lake characteristics and connectivity metrics. We determined individual membership in specific subpopulations using a series of splitting criteria developed using conditional inference trees. The conditional inference tree (ctree) technique is a machine learning method where binary splits of the independent variables are recursively repeated to maximize association with the depedendent variable (citation). In the present study, our dependent variable was P retention while our independent variable was a single given lake characteristics or connectivity metric (Table 1). The advantage of the ctree technique over the more widely used classification-regression tree (CART) technique is that stopping rules are pre-specified. As a result, this avoids some of the subjectivity of post-hoc tree "pruning".

### Connectivity metrics

We calculated several stream connectivity metrics including average link length, stream order ratio, and the closest distance to an upstream lake. Both average link length and stream order ratio are approximations of stream network complexity (citation, fractal stream book). Low connectivity lakes often have highly complex stream networks with a short average link length and a high stream order ratio. The first step in calculating average link length is to dissolve stream network nodes that do not occur at a "fork". Next, the total stream length in the upstream watershed is divided by the total number of stream reaches. We calculated (Strahler) stream order ratio by dividing the number of first-order streams in the upstream watershed of a given lake by the total number of higher order streams (citation). Finally, we calculated closest distance to an upstream lake on a path-distance basis (as the fish swims) rather than on a straight-line basis (as the crow flies).

In addition to stream connectivity metrics, we calculated several lake connectivity metrics including total upstream lake area, number of upstream lakes, and presence/abscence of an upstream lake. For the purposes of calculating lake connectivity metrics, we defined a lake as any waterbody with an area greater than 4 ha (convert to km2). Low connectivity lakes likely have low total upstream area and few upstream lakes.

We calculated both lake and stream connectivity metrics at multiple scales (Figure 1). First, we calculated connectivity metrics at the scale of individual lake watersheds (iws scale). Individual lake watersheds are defined as the area draining to a particular lake exclusive of any upstream areas that drain into a lake greater or equal to 10 ha (Figure 1). We also calculated connectivity metrics at the scale of entire upstream lake networks (nws scale). Network watersheds are defined as the area draining into any part the upstream network regardless of the presence or abscence of upstream lakes.

We calculated all stream connectivity metrics using the `streamnet` and `nhdR` packages (citations). The algorithms in the `streamnet` package use the `sf` R package as well as the `v.net` and `v.stream.order` modules (Jasiewicz and Metz 2011) included in GRASS GIS (GRASS Development Team 2017). We calculated lake connectivity metrics using data in the LAGOSNE dataset (citation). Both sets of connectivity metrics were calculated using the (**include the NHD scale here**) National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as input. Data on lake P retention and residence time come from the National Eutrophication Survey (citations).

## Results

Lakes with both high lake connectivity and high stream connecitvity were most often found in the northern portions of the study area.

## Discussion

Stream connectivity is really stream _complexity_. 

A high stream order ratio indicates a high complexity of streams in the watershed. P inputs to a lake with a high stream order ratio have likely undergone less in-stream processing as high order streams are known to have long/short "spiral distances"(citation).
