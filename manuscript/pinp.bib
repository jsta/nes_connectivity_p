Reliable targeting of critical source areas, such as erosion-prone ﬁelds and parts of ﬁelds, is necessary to improve the cost efﬁciency of mitigation measures. We used high-resolution (2 m 9 2 m) distributed modelling to calculate erosion risk for a large area (202 279 km2) covering [ 90\% of Swedish arable land. Comparison of model results with independent farmers’ observations in a pilot catchment showed high spatial agreement. The modelled worst case scenario produced reasonable quantitative results comparable to measured 90th percentile values of suspended sediment (SS) loads at both ﬁeld and small catchment scale (R2 = 0.81, p $\backslash$ 0.001). Overall, loads of SS, especially during extreme episodes, strongly governed losses of unreactive P and total P at both ﬁeld and catchment scale.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimates of N and P loads were obtained for four contrasting UK river basins over a complete annual cycle. The fractionation of these loads into dissolved and particulate, and inorganic and organic components allowed a detailed examination of the nutrient load composition and of the factors in\textasciimacron{}uencing both the relative and absolute magnitude of these components. The particulate phosphorus (TPP) loads account for 26$\pm$75\% of the annual total phosphorus (TP) transport and are predominantly inorganic. The inorganic (PIP) and organic (POP) fractions of the TPP loads represent 20$\pm$47\% and 6$\pm$28\% of the annual TP transport, respectively. In contrast, the particulate nitrogen loads (TPN) represent 8\% or less of the annual total nitrogen (TN) loads and are predominately organic. For dissolved P transport, the dissolved inorganic fraction (DIP) is more important, representing 15$\pm$70\% of the TP loads, whereas the dissolved organic fraction (DOP) represents only 3$\pm$9\% of the TP loads. The TN loads are dominated by the dissolved component and more particularly the total oxidized fraction (TON), which is composed of nitrate and nitrite and represents 76$\pm$82\% of the annual TN transport. The remaining dissolved N species, ammonium (NH4-N) and organic N (DON) account for 0.3$\pm$1.2\% and 13$\pm$16\% of the annual TN transport, respectively. The TPN and TPP \textasciimacron{}uxes closely re\textasciimacron{}ect the suspended sediment dynamics of the study basins, which are in turn controlled by basin size and morphology. The dissolved inorganic nutrient \textasciimacron{}uxes are in\textasciimacron{}uenced by point source inputs to the study basins, especially for P, although the TON \textasciimacron{}ux is primarily in\textasciimacron{}uenced by diuse source contributions and the hydrological connectivity between the river and its catchment area. The dissolved organic fractions are closely related to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics, which are in turn in\textasciimacron{}uenced by land use and basin size. The magnitude of the NH4-N fraction was dependent on the proximity of the monitoring station to point source discharges, because of rapid nitri\textregistered{}cation within the water column. However, during storm events, desorption from suspended sediment may be temporarily important. Both the magnitude and relative contribution of the dierent nutrient fractions exhibit signi\textregistered{}cant seasonal variability in response to the hydrological regime, sediment mobilization, the degree of dilution of point source inputs and biological processes. \# 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Watersheds are three-dimensional hydrologic systems where the longitudinal expansion/contraction of stream networks, vertical connection/disconnection between shallow and deep groundwater systems, and lateral connectivity of these water sources to streams mediate runoff production and nutrient export. The connectivity of runoff source areas during both baseflow and stormflow conditions and their combined influence on biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly understood. Here we focused on a set of 3.3 and 48.4 ha nested watersheds (North Carolina, USA). These watersheds comprise ephemeral and intermittent runoff-producing headwaters and perennial runoff-producing lowlands. Within these landscape elements, we characterized the timing and magnitude of precipitation, runoff, and runoff-generating flow paths. The active surface drainage network (ASDN) reflected connectivity to, and contributions from, source areas that differed under baseflow and stormflow conditions. The baseflow-associated ASDN expanded and contracted seasonally, driven by the rise and fall of the seasonal water table. Superimposed on this were event-activated source area contributions driven by connectivity to surficial and shallow subsurface flow paths. Frequently activated shallow flow paths also caused increased in-stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with increases in runoff across both watershed scales. The spread and variability within this DOC-runoff relationship was driven by a seasonal depletion of DOC from continual shallow subsurface flow path activation and subsequent replenishment from autumn litterfall. Our findings suggest that hydrobiogeochemical signals at larger watershed outlets can be driven by the expansion, contraction, and connection of lateral, longitudinal, and vertical source areas with distinct runoff generation processes.},

In 25 US lakes, we analysed the effects of dreissenid invasions on changes in Chl and TP concentrations, measured as the probability of a concentration decrease in the post-invasion period and changes in Chl\textendash{}TP relationships using Bayesian hierarchical regressions.

Color was positively related to the drainage ratio, and negatively related to watershed slope, mean lake depth, and lake area. Lakes that receive significant indirect drainage from other lakes were lesscolored than headwater lakes. The best regression model explained 60\% of the variance in lake water color. Regression models were calculated separately for four geographic regions (the Laurentians of Quebec, eastem Quebec-Maine, northeastern Wisconsin, and the Experimental Lakes Area of western Ontario). The regression coefficients for the most significant variables, drainage ratio, watershed slope, and lake area were similar over these four areas, but the regional models still had significantly smaller standard errors than the general model based on the whole data set.},

  abstract = {Natural suspended fine particulate organic matter (FPOM, 53-102-pm diam) was labeled with 14Cand reinjected to estimate transport distances in the water column and retention times within the sediments of two Idaho streams. Transport of labeled FPOM particles declined exponentially with downstream distance. yielding mean transport distances of 800 and 580 m in Smiley Creek in 1989 and 1990 at a mean water velocity of 0.27 m ss' and mean depth of 0.34 m in both years, and a distance of 630 m in the upper Salmon River at a mean velocity of 0.29 m s ' and a depth of 0.14 m. These travel distances are equivalent to vertical deposition velocities of 0.7-l .6 mm s I, or - 7- 12\% of the temperature-corrected quiescent-water fall velocities of the FPOM particles. The estimated deposition flux of - 1.5 g (AFDM) m 1 d ' would turn over the standing stock of 0.8 g m 1 in surficial sediments twice daily. Sampling of benthic FPOM 24 h after release indicated that -99\% of the 14C-labeled FPOM initially deposited in the 1,005-m study reach had been resuspended and exported; subsequent clearing was much slower. An advection-dispersion model satisfactorily simulated the deposition of 14C-labeled particles and their subsequent resuspension and export from the reach. Model-estimated retention times were 1.53 h for 99\% of deposited sediments and 17 d for the remaining 1\%. Thus, particles in surficial sediments exchange rapidly with the water column and migrate downstream several kilometers per day in alternating deposition and resuspension events. These results support the overall concept that conditions throughout a river system are strongly connected longitudinally and that OM introduced in headwater reaches can be transported large distances for later use or storage elsewhere in the river or for eventual export to estuaries.},

While it has been extensively studied in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, there has been limited communication among denitrification scientists working in these individual systems. Here, we compare rates of denitrification and controlling factors across a range of ecosystem types. We suggest that terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems in which denitrification occurs can be organized along a continuum ranging from (1) those in which nitrification and denitrification are tightly coupled in space and time to (2) those in which nitrate production and denitrification are relatively decoupled.},

This study estimated the bioavailability of particulate phosphorus, in forested, urban, agricultural (i.e. dairy farm) and mixed land cover streams. Sixteen stream sites were sampled during base and storm flow conditions and the following parameters were determined: total suspended solids, total phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus, particulate phosphorus, percent bioavailable particulate phosphorus (\%BAPP), total bioavailable phosphorus and sediment particle size distribution. Algal assays with Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were used to measure \%BAPP. Percent BAPP averaged 17\%, 26\% and 24\% for streams draining catchments with forested, mixed use and agricultural land cover, respectively, and \%BAPP did not vary significantly between base and storm flow conditions in these stream types. In contrast, \%BAPP averaged 73\% in the urban streams during baseflows but declined to an average of only 19\% during storms. Particle size distributions did not correlate with \%BAPP in these samples. During storm events, particulate phosphorus concentrations increased in all streams by an average of 614\% and total phosphorus increased by 200\%, whereas total BAP (i.e. total dissolved phosphorus+\%BAPP \^A particulate phosphorus) only increased by 72\% because on average only 20\% of the particulate phosphorus transported during these events was biologically available.},
